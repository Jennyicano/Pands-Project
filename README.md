**About this project**

This repository contain my analysis of the Iris dataset. 



**Use of this project**

This project can be usefull to look at the data related with the Iris flowers. 

In my [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/iris_data.ipynb) I added the comments about the results of my code. In this project the data can be visualized throught plots, histograms, and bar charts. 

In the [Analysis](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/Analysis.py) it can be found all the code and programm that will output the information of the Iris dataset. 

Also, the data can be summarized in a [text file](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/summary.txt) in this repositary.

**Contribute**

Anybody is welcome to contribute in this notebook, and also report any issue that can be found.

**About this project**

This repository contains my analysis of the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). 

This Iris dataset was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 article "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."

The dataset contains 50 samples of each of the 3 species of Iris flower. This 3 type of flowers are: Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor. And the characteristics of this flowers that can be found in the Iris dataset are: petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. 


**Use of this project**

This project can be usefull to look at the data related with the Iris flowers. 

In my [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/iris_data.ipynb) I added the comments about the results of my code. In this project the data can be visualized throught plots, histograms, and bar charts. 

In the [Analysis](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/Analysis.py) it can be found all the code and program that will output the information of the Iris dataset. 

Also, the data is summarized in a [text file](https://github.com/Jennyicano/Pands-Project/blob/main/summary.txt) in this repositary.

**Contribute**

Anybody is welcome to contribute in this notebook, and also report any issue that can be found.

## Getting started.

The tools that I needed to intall in my computer to complete the module tasks and project were the following: 

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). 
* Install the latest version of Git.
* [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
* Cloning the teacher's repository
* Create the [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
